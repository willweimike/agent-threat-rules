## 1. Introduction

ATR (Agent Threat Rules) is an open detection standard for AI agent security threats. ATR rules are declarative YAML files that describe patterns of malicious behavior in AI agent ecosystems. Any conforming engine can load and evaluate ATR rules.

ATR is analogous to [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) for SIEM, but designed for AI agent attack surfaces: prompt injection, tool poisoning, skill compromise, context exfiltration, and more.

### 1.1 Design Principles

1. **YAML-first**: Rules are human-readable, version-controllable, and tool-agnostic.
2. **Engine-agnostic**: This spec defines the rule format and evaluation semantics. Any implementation (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust) that follows this spec is a conforming ATR engine.
3. **Two scan paths**: MCP runtime events and SKILL.md static files are different attack surfaces with different false-positive profiles. Rules declare their `scan_target` and engines MUST respect it.
4. **Detect behavior, not descriptions**: Rules match attack payloads and malicious patterns, not natural language descriptions of attacks.

### 1.2 Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Rule** | A YAML file conforming to this spec that describes one detection pattern. |
| **Engine** | Software that loads rules and evaluates input against them. |
| **AgentEvent** | A structured input representing an AI agent action (LLM I/O, tool call, etc.). |
| **Match** | A rule that triggered on a given input, with confidence score. |
| **scan_target** | Declares whether a rule applies to MCP events (`mcp`), SKILL.md files (`skill`), or runtime behavior (`runtime`). |

## 2. Rule Identifier

### 2.1 Format

```
ATR-YYYY-NNNNN
```

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ATR` | Fixed prefix. |
| `YYYY` | Year the rule was first created (e.g., `2026`). |
| `NNNNN` | 5-digit sequential number, zero-padded (e.g., `00001`). |

### 2.2 Rules

- IDs are globally unique and MUST NOT be reused, even if deprecated.
- IDs are assigned sequentially within a year. There is no category encoding in the ID.
- Category, scan target, and other classifications are in metadata fields, not in the ID.
- Maximum capacity: 99,999 rules per year.

### 2.3 Examples

```
ATR-2026-00001    (first rule created in 2026)
ATR-2026-00120    (120th rule)
ATR-2027-00001    (first rule created in 2027)
```

## 3. Rule Structure

A conforming ATR rule is a YAML file with the following fields.

### 3.1 Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Rule identifier (`ATR-YYYY-NNNNN`). |
| `title` | string | Human-readable name. |
| `status` | enum | `draft`, `experimental`, `stable`, `deprecated`. |
| `description` | string | What attack this rule detects, with context and prevalence data. |
| `author` | string | Author name or organization. |
| `date` | string | Creation date (`YYYY/MM/DD`). |
| `severity` | enum | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `informational`. |
| `tags` | object | Classification metadata (see 3.3). |
| `agent_source` | object | What data stream this rule inspects (see 3.4). |
| `detection` | object | Detection logic (see 3.5). |
| `response` | object | Recommended response actions (see 3.6). |

### 3.2 Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `modified` | string | Last modification date (`YYYY/MM/DD`). |
| `rule_version` | integer | Version number. Bump when detection logic changes. Starts at `1`. |
| `schema_version` | string | ATR spec version this rule conforms to (e.g., `"1.0"`). |
| `detection_tier` | enum | `pattern`, `behavioral`, `protocol`. |
| `maturity` | enum | `experimental`, `test`, `stable`, `deprecated`. |
| `references` | object | Mappings to security frameworks (see 3.7). |
| `test_cases` | object | Embedded validation tests (see 3.8). |

### 3.3 Tags

```yaml
tags:
  category: skill-compromise        # REQUIRED: attack category (see 3.3.1)
  subcategory: malware-delivery      # OPTIONAL: specific sub-classification
  confidence: high                   # OPTIONAL: expected accuracy (high/medium/low)
  scan_target: skill                 # OPTIONAL: mcp | skill | runtime (see 3.3.2)
```

#### 3.3.1 Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `prompt-injection` | Direct, indirect, jailbreak, encoding evasion |
| `tool-poisoning` | Malicious tool descriptions, injected tool responses |
| `context-exfiltration` | Credential theft, system prompt leakage, env var harvesting |
| `agent-manipulation` | Goal hijacking, cross-agent attacks, social engineering |
| `privilege-escalation` | Unauthorized access, scope creep, eval injection |
| `excessive-autonomy` | Runaway loops, resource exhaustion, unauthorized actions |
| `data-poisoning` | Training data corruption, memory manipulation |
| `model-abuse` | Model extraction, malicious fine-tuning |
| `skill-compromise` | Malicious skills, supply chain attacks, rug pulls |

#### 3.3.2 Scan Target

The `scan_target` field declares which scan path a rule belongs to.

| Value | Meaning | Engine Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `mcp` | Rule detects threats in MCP runtime events. | Used by `evaluate()`. MUST NOT be used in skill-only scans. |
| `skill` | Rule detects threats in SKILL.md static files. | Used by `scanSkill()`. MUST NOT be used in MCP-only scans. |
| `runtime` | Rule detects threats in runtime agent behavior. | Used by runtime monitoring (future). |
| *(absent)* | Rule applies to all scan paths. | Used by both `evaluate()` and `scanSkill()`. |

**Why separate**: The string `cat ~/.aws/credentials` is malicious in an MCP tool description but potentially legitimate in a DevOps SKILL.md. Same pattern, different context, different verdict. Engines MUST filter rules by `scan_target` to avoid cross-contamination false positives.

### 3.4 Agent Source

```yaml
agent_source:
  type: mcp_exchange        # REQUIRED
  framework: [any]           # OPTIONAL
  provider: [any]            # OPTIONAL
```

#### Source Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `llm_io` | LLM prompts and completions |
| `tool_call` | Tool/function call requests |
| `tool_response` | Tool/function call responses |
| `mcp_exchange` | MCP protocol messages (tool descriptions, responses) |
| `agent_behavior` | Agent behavioral metrics (latency, token count, etc.) |
| `multi_agent_comm` | Inter-agent messages |
| `context_window` | Context window contents |
| `memory_access` | Agent memory read/write operations |
| `skill_lifecycle` | Skill registration, update, removal events |
| `skill_permission` | Skill permission requests and boundary checks |
| `skill_chain` | Multi-skill invocation sequences |

### 3.5 Detection Logic

ATR supports two condition formats.

#### 3.5.1 Array Format (recommended for most rules)

```yaml
detection:
  condition: any           # "any" = OR, "all" = AND
  conditions:
    - field: content
      operator: regex
      value: "(?i)ignore\\s+(all\\s+)?previous\\s+instructions"
      description: "Instruction override attempt"
    - field: content
      operator: regex
      value: "(?i)you\\s+are\\s+now\\s+(an?\\s+)?unrestricted"
      description: "Jailbreak persona switch"
```

**Fields**:
- `field`: Which part of the input to inspect. Common values: `content`, `tool_name`, `tool_args`, `tool_response`, `user_input`, `agent_output`.
- `operator`: `regex`, `contains`, `exact`, `starts_with`.
- `value`: The pattern to match. For `regex`, this is a PCRE-compatible regular expression.
- `description`: Human-readable explanation of what this condition detects.

**Condition logic**:
- `any` (or `or`): Rule triggers if ANY condition matches.
- `all` (or `and`): Rule triggers only if ALL conditions match.

#### 3.5.2 Named Format (for complex/multi-step detection)

```yaml
detection:
  condition: "pattern_match AND (behavioral OR sequence)"
  conditions:
    pattern_match:
      field: content
      patterns: ["(?i)eval\\(", "(?i)exec\\("]
      match_type: regex
    behavioral:
      metric: tool_calls_per_minute
      operator: gt
      threshold: 50
      window: 5m
    sequence:
      ordered: true
      within: 10m
      steps:
        - field: content
          patterns: ["(?i)read.*credentials"]
          match_type: regex
        - field: content
          patterns: ["(?i)curl|wget|fetch"]
          match_type: regex
```

**Condition expression**: A boolean expression referencing named conditions. Supports `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and parentheses.

#### 3.5.3 Evaluation Algorithm

A conforming engine MUST:

1. Load all rules from the rules directory.
2. For each input, iterate over all non-draft, non-deprecated rules.
3. Check `agent_source.type` compatibility (see 5.1).
4. Check `scan_target` compatibility (see 5.2).
5. Evaluate each condition against the input.
6. Apply the `condition` logic (any/all/expression) to determine if the rule matches.
7. Calculate a confidence score (0.0-1.0) based on the rule's `confidence` tag and the ratio of matched conditions to total conditions.
8. Return all matches sorted by severity (critical first), then by confidence (highest first).

### 3.6 Response Actions

```yaml
response:
  actions:
    - block_input
    - alert
```

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `block_input` | Reject the input before the agent processes it. |
| `block_output` | Suppress the agent's response. |
| `block_tool` | Prevent the tool call from executing. |
| `quarantine_session` | Isolate the entire session. |
| `reset_context` | Clear agent context/memory. |
| `alert` | Send alert to security team. |
| `snapshot` | Capture full session state for forensics. |
| `escalate` | Escalate to human reviewer. |
| `reduce_permissions` | Reduce agent's available capabilities. |
| `kill_agent` | Terminate the agent process. |

Response actions are RECOMMENDATIONS. Engines MAY implement any subset. The `alert` action SHOULD be implemented by all conforming engines.

### 3.7 References

```yaml
references:
  owasp_llm: ["LLM01:2025"]
  owasp_agentic: ["ASI01:2026"]
  owasp_ast: ["AST01:2026"]
  mitre_atlas: ["AML.T0054"]
  mitre_attack: ["T1059"]
  cve: ["CVE-2026-12345"]
```

All reference fields are optional arrays of strings.

### 3.8 Test Cases

Every rule SHOULD include at least 3 true positives and 3 true negatives.

```yaml
test_cases:
  true_positives:
    - input: "ignore all previous instructions"
      expected: trigger
  true_negatives:
    - input: "How do I sort a list in Python?"
      expected: no_trigger
```

Test inputs MUST be real attack payloads or realistic benign content. Test inputs MUST NOT be descriptions of attacks (e.g., "this skill attempts to steal credentials" is NOT a valid test case).

## 4. Severity Rubric

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `critical` | Direct RCE, credential exfiltration, reverse shell, malware delivery | `curl \| bash`, `base64 -d \| sh`, exfiltrate `~/.aws/credentials` |
| `high` | Data leakage, behavior hijacking, context poisoning, rug pull setup | System prompt leak, jailbreak, `eval(fetch(...))` |
| `medium` | Permission overreach, supply chain risk, suspicious patterns | Over-privileged skill, name squatting, fork impersonation |
| `low` | Anomalous behavior that needs context, potential false positive | Unusual tool call frequency, large context window usage |
| `informational` | Noteworthy pattern with no direct security impact | Deprecated API usage, missing best practices |

## 5. Engine Requirements

### 5.1 Source Type Matching

An engine MUST match rule `agent_source.type` against the input event type using this mapping:

| Event Type | Matches Rule Source Types |
|------------|--------------------------|
| `llm_input` | `llm_io` |
| `llm_output` | `llm_io` |
| `tool_call` | `tool_call`, `mcp_exchange` |
| `tool_response` | `mcp_exchange` |
| `agent_behavior` | `agent_behavior` |
| `multi_agent_message` | `multi_agent_comm` |
| `mcp_exchange` | `mcp_exchange` |

Note: `tool_call` events match both `tool_call` and `mcp_exchange` rules, because MCP tool calls are a subset of general tool calls.

### 5.2 Scan Target Filtering

When scanning **SKILL.md files** (static scan), an engine MUST:
- Only evaluate rules with `scan_target: skill` (or no `scan_target`).
- Skip rules with `scan_target: mcp` or `scan_target: runtime`.

When scanning **MCP events** (runtime scan), an engine MUST:
- Only evaluate rules with `scan_target: mcp` (or no `scan_target`).
- Skip rules with `scan_target: skill` or `scan_target: runtime`.

This separation prevents cross-contamination false positives.

### 5.3 No Short-Circuit Allow

Engines MUST NOT short-circuit evaluation with an early "allow" decision. All applicable rules MUST be evaluated for every input. A single matching rule can escalate the verdict from allow to deny.

This requirement exists because short-circuit allow creates a bypass vulnerability: an attacker who can trigger an early allow in one rule can prevent all subsequent rules from firing.

### 5.4 Rule Versioning

When a rule's `rule_version` field changes, engines that cache or sync rules SHOULD re-evaluate any cached verdicts for content previously scanned by that rule.

### 5.5 Unified Output Format

Engines SHOULD produce a `ScanResult` containing:

```
{
  scan_type: "mcp" | "skill",
  content_hash: <SHA-256 hex digest of input>,
  timestamp: <ISO 8601>,
  rules_loaded: <count>,
  matches: [
    {
      rule_id: "ATR-2026-NNNNN",
      severity: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low" | "informational",
      confidence: 0.0-1.0,
      matched_conditions: [<indices or names>],
      matched_patterns: [<regex patterns that matched>]
    }
  ],
  threat_count: <count>
}
```

The `content_hash` enables deduplication across distributed scanning networks.

## 6. File Naming Convention

```
ATR-YYYY-NNNNN-<short-description>.yaml

Example: ATR-2026-00001-direct-prompt-injection.yaml
```

Rules are organized in directories by attack category:
```
rules/
  prompt-injection/
  tool-poisoning/
  context-exfiltration/
  agent-manipulation/
  privilege-escalation/
  excessive-autonomy/
  data-poisoning/
  model-security/
  skill-compromise/
```

## 7. Versioning

### 7.1 Specification Versioning

This specification uses semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR`.
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to required fields or evaluation semantics.
- MINOR: Additive changes (new optional fields, new categories).

### 7.2 Rule Versioning

Individual rules have a `rule_version` integer field:
- Starts at `1` when the rule is created.
- Incremented when detection logic (`detection.conditions` or `detection.condition`) changes.
- Metadata-only changes (description, references) do NOT require a version bump.
- Third-party integrators use `rule_version` to determine when to re-sync rules.

## 8. Reference Implementation

The reference ATR engine is written in TypeScript and published as `agent-threat-rules` on npm.

- Repository: https://github.com/anthropic-security/agent-threat-rules
- API: `ATREngine.evaluate(event)` for MCP scan, `ATREngine.scanSkill(content)` for SKILL.md scan.
- License: MIT.

Other implementations in Python, Go, or Rust are encouraged. This spec is the source of truth, not the TypeScript implementation.
