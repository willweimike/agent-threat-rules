# ATR Core Specification

Version: 1.0.0
Status: Draft
Date: 2026-05-16
License: MIT
Editor: Adam Lin (林冠辛) <adam@agentthreatrule.org>
Numbering Authority: ATR Technical Committee (transitional BDFL until TSC seated)

## 1. Abstract

This document specifies the wire format, evaluation semantics, identifier scheme,
and conformance criteria for Agent Threat Rules (ATR), an open detection rule
standard for AI agent security threats. ATR provides a vendor-neutral way to
express, exchange, and execute detections against AI agent artifacts
(SKILL.md files, MCP tool definitions, agent configurations) and AI agent
runtime events (LLM input/output, tool invocations, context windows). Any
software that loads ATR rule YAML and emits matches in conformance with this
specification is an ATR-compatible engine.

## 2. Status of This Document

This is a Draft of ATR Core v1.0.0. Distribution is unlimited. The Draft is
stable for implementation. Changes prior to Final status will be limited to
editorial corrections and clarifications that do not alter rule wire format or
evaluation outcome.

This document is intended to be advanced to Final status after a 30-day public
comment period and after at least two independent implementations have been
verified against the Conformance Test Suite (Section 12).

## 3. Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when,
they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Rule | A YAML document conforming to Section 5 that describes one detection pattern. |
| Rule ID | A globally unique identifier in the form `ATR-YYYY-NNNNN` (Section 4). |
| Engine | Software that loads Rules and evaluates Inputs against them. |
| Input | A structured artifact (SKILL.md, MCP tool definition, agent config) or a runtime AgentEvent submitted to an Engine for evaluation. |
| AgentEvent | A structured representation of an AI agent action (LLM I/O, tool call, context window state). |
| Match | An Engine's output indicating that a Rule's detection condition evaluated to true for a given Input. |
| Numbering Authority | The body authorized to assign permanent Rule IDs (currently the ATR project Maintainer; transitions to the TSC under GOVERNANCE.md). |
| Conformance Level | One of L1, L2, L3 (Section 11). |
| Corpus | The set of Rules officially published under a given ATR version. |

## 4. Rule Identifier

### 4.1 Format

A Rule ID MUST match the regular expression:

```
^ATR-([0-9]{4})-([0-9]{5})$
```

where the first capture group is the four-digit year of first creation and the
second capture group is a zero-padded five-digit sequential number assigned by
the Numbering Authority.

### 4.2 Assignment Rules

1. Rule IDs MUST be assigned by the Numbering Authority and MUST NOT be
   self-assigned by contributors.
2. Once assigned, a Rule ID MUST be considered permanent and MUST NOT be
   reassigned to a different Rule, even if the originally-assigned Rule is
   deprecated.
3. A Rule ID MUST NOT encode classification information (category, severity,
   scan target). Classification is carried in metadata fields per Section 5.
4. A Rule ID MUST be globally unique within the official Corpus.
5. Contributors SHOULD use a placeholder identifier of the form
   `ATR-YYYY-DRAFT-<hex>` in pull requests prior to merge. The Numbering
   Authority assigns the permanent ID on merge.

### 4.3 Forks and Unofficial Assignments

A fork of the ATR repository MAY duplicate existing Rule YAML files but MUST
NOT assign new IDs in the `ATR-YYYY-NNNNN` namespace. Self-assigned IDs from a
fork are not part of the official Corpus and conformant Engines SHOULD NOT
present them as authoritative.

## 5. Rule Document Structure

A conforming Rule is a UTF-8 encoded YAML 1.2 document whose top-level value
is a mapping. The mapping MUST contain at minimum the fields enumerated in
Section 5.1 and MAY contain the fields enumerated in Section 5.2. Unknown
top-level fields MUST be preserved by an Engine that round-trips Rules but
MUST NOT alter evaluation outcomes.

### 5.1 Required Fields

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | MUST match Section 4.1; MUST be unique in the Corpus. |
| `title` | string | 1 ≤ length ≤ 200. Human-readable name. |
| `status` | enum | MUST be one of `draft`, `experimental`, `stable`, `deprecated`. |
| `description` | string | 50 ≤ length ≤ 4000. MUST describe the attack class, not the rule mechanics. |
| `author` | string | 1 ≤ length ≤ 200. |
| `date` | string | ISO 8601 date `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY/MM/DD`. |
| `severity` | enum | MUST be one of `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `informational`. |
| `tags` | object | MUST contain `category` and `scan_target` per Section 5.3. |
| `agent_source` | object | MUST conform to Section 5.4. |
| `detection` | object | MUST conform to Section 6. |
| `response` | object | MUST conform to Section 5.5. |
| `test_cases` | object | MUST contain ≥5 `true_positives` and ≥5 `true_negatives` per Section 11. |

### 5.2 Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `maturity` | enum | One of `experimental`, `test`, `production`, `stable`. Defaults to `experimental`. |
| `confidence` | enum | One of `low`, `medium`, `high`. |
| `references` | array | URLs or CVE identifiers. |
| `compliance` | object | Crosswalk mapping per Section 9. |
| `replaced_by` | string | If `status` is `deprecated`, MUST point to a successor Rule ID. |
| `wild_fp_rate` | number | 0.0–1.0; the false-positive rate observed on the published benign Corpus. |

### 5.3 Tags

```yaml
tags:
  category: prompt-injection   # one of the 10 canonical categories
  scan_target: skill           # one of: mcp | skill | runtime
```

Conformant Engines MUST honor `scan_target`: a Rule with `scan_target: skill`
MUST NOT be evaluated against an MCP AgentEvent, and vice versa. The 10
canonical categories are enumerated in Section 8.

### 5.4 Agent Source

```yaml
agent_source:
  type: skill_file           # mcp_tool | skill_file | llm_io | tool_call | context_window
  field: content              # the field within the source to inspect
```

The `type` value MUST come from the enumerated set above; future values are
introduced by Spec amendment, not by individual Rule authors.

### 5.5 Response

```yaml
response:
  actions:
    - block_request         # canonical action vocabulary; see Appendix A
    - log_alert
  user_message: "Optional analyst-facing message"
```

Engines MUST NOT execute response actions automatically without an explicit
configuration directive from the operator. The `response` field is a
recommendation expressed by the Rule author, not a directive to the Engine.

## 6. Detection Semantics

### 6.1 Match Definition

Given a Rule R and an Input I, an Engine MUST emit a Match if, and only if,
all conditions in `R.detection.condition` evaluate to true against I per the
combinator semantics defined in Section 6.2.

### 6.2 Condition Combinators

`R.detection.condition` is a logical expression over named selectors defined
under `R.detection.selectors`. The allowed combinators are:

| Combinator | Semantics |
|------------|-----------|
| `S` | true iff selector S matches |
| `S1 and S2` | true iff both S1 and S2 match |
| `S1 or S2` | true iff S1 or S2 matches |
| `not S` | true iff S does not match |
| `all of S*` | true iff every selector matched by the wildcard matches |
| `1 of S*` | true iff at least one selector matched by the wildcard matches |

The `all of` and `1 of` aggregators MUST be supported for v1.0.0 conformance.

### 6.3 Selector Operators

A selector is a mapping from field path to operator + operand. Conformant
Engines MUST implement the following operators with the semantics given:

| Operator | Semantics |
|----------|-----------|
| `contains` | Case-sensitive substring match. |
| `contains_i` | Case-insensitive substring match. |
| `regex` | The operand is treated as an ECMAScript-compatible regular expression. Engines MUST anchor input scanning across the entire Input field, not only line-by-line. |
| `equals` | Exact string equality. |
| `startswith` | Prefix match. |
| `endswith` | Suffix match. |
| `length_gt`, `length_lt` | Numeric comparison of field length. |
| `in` | Operand is a list; selector matches if field equals any element. |

Engines MUST reject Rules that use operators outside this list, with a
clear error message identifying the unknown operator. Silently treating an
unknown operator as no-match would convert an authoring mistake into a
silent false negative. Engines MAY define additional operators as
extensions, but MUST treat Rules using such extensions as non-portable and
MUST NOT promote them to Conformance Level L2 or L3.

### 6.4 Determinism

For a given Engine version, a given Rule, and a given Input, the Match outcome
MUST be deterministic. Engines MUST NOT introduce non-determinism (e.g.,
randomized sampling, time-of-day branching) into Rule evaluation.

## 7. Match Output

An Engine MUST emit Match output that includes, at minimum:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "ATR-2026-00001",
  "corpus_version": "2.2.2",
  "input_identifier": "<engine-supplied stable handle for the Input>",
  "matched_at": "2026-05-16T03:14:15Z",
  "severity": "high",
  "category": "prompt-injection",
  "matched_selectors": ["sel_inline_exec", "sel_credential_exfil"]
}
```

`corpus_version` is the SemVer string of the ATR corpus the engine was
loaded with at the time of the match. Individual rules carry no separate
version field; the corpus is versioned as a whole per §10.

Engines MAY emit additional fields. The output format MAY be JSON, SARIF,
STIX 2.1 (via the `x-atr-rule` extension), or any other serialization, but
the listed fields MUST be present.

## 8. Canonical Categories

The following ten categories are normative for v1.0.0. New categories MUST be
introduced only by Spec amendment per GOVERNANCE.md.

1. `prompt-injection`
2. `agent-manipulation`
3. `skill-compromise`
4. `context-exfiltration`
5. `tool-poisoning`
6. `privilege-escalation`
7. `model-abuse`
8. `excessive-autonomy`
9. `model-security`
10. `data-poisoning`

## 9. Crosswalks (Optional)

A Rule MAY include a `compliance` object mapping the detection to external
frameworks:

```yaml
compliance:
  owasp_agentic: [ASI01, ASI03]
  owasp_llm: [LLM01]
  mitre_atlas: [AML.T0051.000]
  nist_ai_rmf: [MS-2.6, MG-2.2]
  iso_iec_42001: [A.6.2.1]
  eu_ai_act: [Art.15]
  safe_mcp: [SAFE-T1101]
```

Identifiers MUST come from the authoritative source for each framework. Where
ambiguity exists, Rule authors SHOULD include a `references` entry pointing to
the source document.

## 10. Versioning

ATR follows Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 with the following project-specific
contract:

- Major (X.0.0): breaking change to wire format, identifier scheme, or
  evaluation semantics.
- Minor (X.Y.0): new categories, new operators, new optional fields, or any
  change adding capability without breaking existing conforming Engines.
- Patch (X.Y.Z): Rule corpus additions, deprecations, or editorial spec
  changes that do not require Engine updates.

A deprecated field MUST remain valid for at least one Major version after
deprecation is announced in CHANGELOG.md and in the Spec.

## 11. Conformance Levels

| Level | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| L1 | Engine loads the published Corpus without parse errors and emits Match output per Section 7 for at least one Rule. |
| L2 | Engine passes 100% of the Conformance Test Suite (Section 12) against the published Corpus for the declared Spec version. |
| L3 | Engine passes L2 AND emits Match output in at least two interchange formats (JSON + one of: SARIF, STIX 2.1, MISP, OpenCTI), AND publishes its results against the public benign Corpus with documented FP rate. |

An implementation MAY claim "ATR-compatible" only with a declared Conformance
Level and a reproducible test report.

## 12. Conformance Test Suite

The Conformance Test Suite is published in the `conformance/` directory of
the canonical repository under the same MIT license as the Spec.

The suite v1.0.0 ships at least 100 true-positive fixtures, at least 100
true-negative fixtures, and 20 edge-case fixtures covering catastrophic
regex inputs, malformed YAML and JSON, oversized inputs, deeply nested
structures, zero-width and RTL-override characters, null-byte injection,
and control-character payloads. Fixtures are generated deterministically
from the embedded `test_cases` blocks of the rule corpus via
`conformance/v1.0/runner/generate-fixtures.ts`, plus a curated edge set
in `conformance/v1.0/runner/generate-edge-fixtures.ts`.

An Engine claiming L2 conformance MUST pass 100% of the labeled fixtures
present in the declared suite version, MUST produce zero false positives
across the labeled true-negative fixtures of that same version, and MUST
handle every edge-case fixture by returning either no_match or a
graceful_error within the per-fixture runtime budget. An Engine MUST
publish the suite version it was tested against in any conformance claim.

## 13. Security and Privacy Considerations

### 13.1 Trust Boundary

Rules are content that an Engine evaluates against potentially untrusted
Inputs. An Engine MUST NOT permit a Rule's `description`, `references`, or
other free-form metadata fields to alter evaluation behavior. The only fields
that affect evaluation are those enumerated in Sections 5.3, 5.4, 6, 7.

### 13.2 Resource Exhaustion

A malformed `regex` selector may cause catastrophic backtracking. Engines
MUST apply a per-rule execution timeout (RECOMMENDED: 100 ms per Input per
Rule) and MUST report a timeout as a non-match rather than an error.

### 13.3 PII in Match Output

If a Rule's matched substring contains PII or sensitive credentials, Engines
SHOULD provide a redaction option that hashes or truncates the matched
substring before emitting Match output. The Rule MAY hint at this with a
`response.redact_match: true` field.

### 13.4 Reporting Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities in this Spec or the reference Engine implementation are
reported per SECURITY.md.

## 14. IANA Considerations

This Specification requests registration of the following media types:

- `application/vnd.atr.rule+yaml` — a single ATR Rule
- `application/vnd.atr.corpus+yaml` — a corpus manifest listing multiple Rules
- `application/vnd.atr.match+json` — Match output per Section 7

Registration templates appear in Appendix B.
