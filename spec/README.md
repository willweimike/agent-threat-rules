**Status:** v1.0 — Draft for OASIS Open Project submission — NOT RATIFIED
**License:** CC BY 4.0 (spec docs and schemas); CC0 (conformance corpus); MIT (reference implementations); CC BY 4.0 (rules)
**Governance:** governance/CHARTER.md v2.0 (PROPOSED — TSC not yet formed)

## What ATR is, in one paragraph

ATR is an open machine-readable detection-rule standard for AI agent
threats. It is to AI agent security what Sigma is to SIEM detection,
YARA is to malware signatures, and CVE/CWE is to software
vulnerabilities. ATR rules are YAML files with declarative patterns
that any conformant engine can load and evaluate. The standard is
maintained by a 9-seat Technical Steering Committee (TSC) under
fiscal sponsorship of Open Source Collective Inc. The corpus is
licensed CC BY 4.0; reference implementations are MIT; conformance
test artifacts are CC0.

## The four-layer standard

ATR separates four concerns. This separation is the foundation of
the standard's architecture per governance/CHARTER.md § Appendix A.

| Layer | Lives in | Governance |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Specification** (the immutable contract — what conformant implementations must do) | `spec/` + repo-root `ATR-SPEC-v1.md` | TSC AEP process (Tier 3) |
| **2. Reference implementation** (proves the spec is buildable) | `engines/typescript/` + `engines/python/` + `engines/go/` | Maintainer-led; tested against `spec/conformance/` |
| **3. Production engines + integrations** (consumers of the spec) | `src/` (existing TypeScript engine), `integrations/{rampart,sigma,sentinel,splunk,opentelemetry}/` | Vendor-controlled; pass conformance to claim conformance |
| **4. Conformance test corpus** (objective evidence anyone implements correctly) | `spec/conformance/` | TSC; signed with ed25519 key |

## How to read the spec

If you are **implementing an ATR engine**, read in this order:

1. `ATR-SPEC-v1.md` — rule format. Defines what a rule is and how
   it evaluates.
2. `spec/atr-schema.yaml` and `spec/schema/rule.schema.json` —
   machine-readable rule schemas.
3. `spec/atr-language-detection-v1.0.md` — the deterministic
   algorithm your engine MUST implement for per-language conditions.
4. `spec/atr-event-v1.0.md` and `spec/schema/event.schema.json` —
   the event format your engine MUST emit when a rule fires.
5. `spec/category-registry/v1.0.yaml` — categories your engine
   recognises (and forward-compatibility for unknown categories).
6. `spec/conformance/` (when published) — the test corpus your
   engine MUST pass.
7. `spec/atr-profile-v1.0.md` + `spec/atr-correlation-v1.0.md` —
   RECOMMENDED for full conformance, optional for baseline.

If you are **authoring rules**, read:

1. `ATR-SPEC-v1.md` — rule fields and evaluation semantics
2. `spec/atr-schema.yaml` — required and optional fields
3. `spec/category-registry/v1.0.yaml` — pick a category
4. `spec/atr-language-detection-v1.0.md` — only if writing
   per-language conditions
5. Existing rules in `rules/<category>/*.yaml` for patterns

If you are **adopting ATR in your product**, read:

1. `README.md` (repo root) — overview
2. `governance/CHARTER.md` — governance model
3. `spec/atr-profile-v1.0.md` — pick which profile your product
   claims conformance to
4. `spec/atr-event-v1.0.md` — your product's output integration
5. `certification/program-guide.md` (when published) —
   ATR-Certified™ program

If you are **a regulator or standards-body reviewer**, read:

1. `governance/CHARTER.md` — TSC structure, IPR, fiscal sponsorship
2. `governance/STANDARD-THREAT-MODEL.md` — what attacks against
   the standard itself we've designed for
3. `spec/README.md` (this file) — index
4. `ai-rmf-oscal-catalog` (separate repo) — NIST AI RMF mapping

If you are **a sovereign authority** considering issuing rules in a
sovereign sub-range:

1. `governance/CHARTER.md` § 8 — sovereign sub-range governance
2. `spec/atr-profile-v1.0.md` — sovereign profile examples
3. `spec/schema/rule.schema.json` — `provenance.attestation_signature`
   field

## Conformance levels

A conformant ATR engine claim names what the engine can do. Three
levels:

**Level 1 — Baseline Conformance.** Engine implements:
- Rule schema (`spec/schema/rule.schema.json`)
- Event schema (`spec/schema/event.schema.json`)
- Language detection (`spec/atr-language-detection-v1.0.md`)
- Category registry forward-compat (`spec/category-registry/v1.0.yaml`)
- Passes `spec/conformance/baseline/` corpus

**Level 2 — Profile Conformance.** Adds:
- Profile resolution (`spec/atr-profile-v1.0.md` and schema)
- Multiple profile loading + isolated evaluation
- Passes `spec/conformance/profiles/` corpus

**Level 3 — Correlation Conformance.** Adds:
- Correlation rule evaluation (`spec/atr-correlation-v1.0.md` and schema)
- State management across events
- Implements at least `temporal_sequence`, `count_threshold`, and
  `chain_propagation` correlation types
- Passes `spec/conformance/correlation/` corpus

Engines may claim any subset of levels (e.g., L1+L3 without L2). The
ATR-Certified™ program awards trust marks per level.

---

## Versioning policy

The spec uses SemVer with the following rules:

- **PATCH** (`1.0.x`): editorial changes, additional examples,
  conformance corpus expansion. Engines MUST continue to pass.
- **MINOR** (`1.x.0`): backward-compatible field additions (e.g.,
  new optional rule field). Engines SHOULD adopt within 6 months.
- **MAJOR** (`x.0.0`): breaking changes. Engines MUST adopt to
  claim new-version conformance. Minimum 12-month deprecation
  window for the prior major version.

Each spec document declares its individual version (e.g.,
`atr-event-v1.0.md`). The overall spec version is the lowest of
all individual spec versions.

Major-version bumps require ATR Enhancement Proposal (AEP) Tier 3
vote per governance/CHARTER.md § 4.

## How this spec evolves

New spec components and changes to existing components go through
the **ATR Enhancement Proposal (AEP)** process defined in
governance/CHARTER.md § 5.

AEP template at `rfc/TEMPLATE-AEP.md` (Phase 3 deliverable). Open
AEPs are tracked in `rfc/`.

Reported issues and bugs in the spec go through GitHub Issues with
the `spec-bug` label, expedited as Tier 2 votes (simple majority of
5 of 9 TSC).

## Cross-references to related specs

- **Sigma** (SIEM detection rules): different domain (SIEM event
  patterns vs AI-agent runtime patterns), but ATR's rule structure
  draws explicitly on Sigma's design and the bidirectional Sigma ↔
  ATR converter at `integrations/sigma/` (Phase 4 deliverable)
  lets adopters cross-pollinate.
- **STIX 2.1** (Structured Threat Information eXpression): ATR
  publishes a STIX 2.1 extension at `spec/stix-extension/` so ATR
  events flow into STIX-native CTI platforms.
- **OSCAL** (NIST compliance): ATR events map to OSCAL `observation`
  records per `spec/atr-event-v1.0.md` § OSCAL mapping. Companion
  CC0 catalog at `Agent-Threat-Rule/ai-rmf-oscal-catalog`.
- **MITRE ATLAS**: each ATR rule declares MITRE ATLAS technique
  mappings in its `references.mitre_atlas` field. Current coverage
  100 of 113 ATLAS techniques per `docs/MITRE-ATLAS-MAPPING.md`.
- **OWASP Agentic Top 10**: each ATR rule declares OWASP Agentic
  mappings in `references.owasp_agentic`. Full 10/10 category
  coverage per `docs/OWASP-AGENTIC-MAPPING.md`.
- **EU AI Act Article 50**: ATR events carry the evidence fields
  required for Article 50 deployer obligations (signature, agent
  identity, deployment-time provenance). See
  `spec/atr-event-v1.0.md` § Required fields.
- **C2PA** (Content Credentials): when a deepfake-related rule
  fires on agent-generated media, the event includes a C2PA
  manifest reference if available.

## Submission to standards bodies

The spec is being prepared for:

1. **OASIS Open Project (primary)** as adjacent to CoSAI. See
   `panguard-outreach/2026-05-25-standardization-phase0/OASIS-APPROACH-MEMO.md`.
   Target: Q3 2026 acceptance, Q1 2027 first Committee Specification.
2. **NIST CAISI (citation target)**. See
   `panguard-outreach/2026-05-25-standardization-phase0/NIST-CAISI-POSITION-PAPER.md`.
   No formal submission window currently open; awaiting next RFI.
3. **IETF (informational draft, transport / OTEL emission only)**
   when reference implementations are stable.

The spec is not yet submitted to any standards body; current state
is "Draft v1.0, community-maintained at GitHub, transitioning to
OASIS Open Project."
