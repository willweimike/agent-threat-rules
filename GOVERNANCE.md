# ATR Governance

Version 1.1 · Effective 2026-04-15

## Position in the AI Security Ecosystem

ATR provides **executable detection rules** for AI agent threats. It
complements, rather than replaces, existing frameworks:

- **MITRE ATLAS** maps adversarial tactics and techniques against AI
  systems. ATR provides the detection rules that operationalize those
  tactics into scannable patterns. ATR is to ATLAS what Sigma rules are
  to ATT&CK.
- **OWASP Agentic Top 10** categorizes risk. ATR provides the rules that
  detect those risks in real agent artifacts (SKILL.md, MCP tool
  descriptions, agent configs).
- **NIST AI RMF** defines risk management processes. ATR rules are one
  concrete implementation of detection controls within that framework.

ATR is not a taxonomy, a risk framework, or a governance standard. It is
a **rule corpus** — the executable layer that makes those frameworks
actionable at scan time.

## License Commitment

ATR is licensed under the **MIT License**. This is a permanent,
irrevocable commitment. ATR will never adopt BSL, SSPL, or any other
source-available license that restricts use, modification, or
distribution. The entire rule corpus, engine, and tooling will remain
MIT-licensed indefinitely.

This commitment exists because ATR's value as a standard depends on
unrestricted adoption. A detection standard that restricts who can use
it is not a standard — it is a product. Cisco, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and
every individual developer must be able to embed ATR rules without
license concerns.

## ATR Numbering Authority

Every rule in the official ATR corpus carries a unique identifier in the
format `ATR-YYYY-NNNNN` (e.g. `ATR-2026-00161`). This identifier is
analogous to a CVE number: it is the canonical name by which the entire
ecosystem references a specific detection pattern.

### Who assigns IDs

The **ATR Numbering Authority** is the maintainer team of the
[Agent-Threat-Rule/agent-threat-rules](https://github.com/Agent-Threat-Rule/agent-threat-rules)
repository. As of v1.0, this is a single-maintainer authority. The
governance model will evolve toward a multi-stakeholder committee as
adoption grows (see Roadmap below).

### How IDs are assigned

1. **Community contributions** (pull requests): the contributor proposes
   a rule with `id: ATR-YYYY-DRAFT-<hex>` (draft ID). On merge, the
   maintainer assigns the next available `ATR-YYYY-NNNNN` number.

2. **Threat Cloud crystallization**: the automated pipeline generates
   rules with `id: ATR-YYYY-DRAFT-<hex>`. On promotion through the
   canary gate and PR-back to the main repo, the maintainer assigns a
   permanent number.

3. **Vendor-contributed packs**: when an external vendor (Cisco, Microsoft,
   NVIDIA, etc.) contributes a batch of rules, the maintainer reserves a
   contiguous block of IDs and assigns them on merge.

### What an ID guarantees

- **Uniqueness**: no two rules share the same `ATR-YYYY-NNNNN`.
- **Immutability**: once assigned, the ID is never reused, even if the
  rule is deprecated. Deprecated rules carry `status: deprecated` and a
  `replaced_by` field pointing to the successor.
- **Traceability**: the ID appears in scan output, SARIF reports, Guard
  alerts, Cisco AI Defense logs, and any downstream consumer. A security
  analyst can always trace an alert back to the canonical rule YAML.

### Why this cannot be forked

A fork of the ATR repository can duplicate the rule files, but it
**cannot assign new IDs that the ecosystem recognizes**. If a fork
publishes `ATR-2026-99999`, no ATR-compatible scanner, no Cisco
integration, and no Threat Cloud instance will accept that ID as
official. The numbering authority is the social contract, not the code.

This is the same mechanism that makes CVE numbers meaningful: MITRE is
the numbering authority, and a self-assigned "CVE" from an unrecognized
source has no standing.

## Quality Standard

All rules in the official ATR corpus must meet the quality bar defined
in [RFC-001 v1.1](docs/proposals/001-atr-quality-standard-rfc.md).

The quality gate is enforced by:

- **CI**: the `ATR Rule Quality` GitHub Actions check runs
  `validateRuleMeetsStandard()` on every PR.
- **Threat Cloud v2**: the crystallization pipeline runs the same function
  plus self-test (L1) and tool-use deduplication before inserting a
  proposal into the database.
- **Reference implementation**: `src/quality/quality-gate.ts` is the
  canonical code. Any vendor can import it via
  `@agent-threat-rules/quality`.

---

## Rule Contribution Process

### 1. Propose

Open a GitHub Issue with:
- Attack description (what behavior does this detect?)
- At least 1 real-world example payload
- Suggested severity and category
- Research source (blog, CVE, paper, incident report)

### 2. Draft

Open a PR with a rule YAML file under `rules/<category>/`. Use
`id: ATR-YYYY-DRAFT-<hex>` as placeholder. The rule must pass:

- Schema validation (`atr validate`)
- All embedded test cases (`atr test`)
- RFC-001 v1.1 quality gate (`validateRuleMeetsStandard`)
- SKILL.md benchmark regression check (precision/recall must not drop)

### 3. Review

The maintainer (Numbering Authority) reviews the PR for:

- **Deduplication**: does this overlap with an existing rule?
- **Precision**: will this trigger on legitimate skills?
- **Specificity**: is the regex narrow enough for production blocking?
- **References**: are OWASP + MITRE mappings correct?
- **Test coverage**: are the 5+ TPs real attack payloads (not descriptions)?

### 4. Merge + ID assignment

On approval, the maintainer assigns the next available `ATR-YYYY-NNNNN`
and merges. The ID is permanent.

### 5. Publication

Merged rules are automatically:
- Published in the next `npm publish` of `agent-threat-rules`
- Synced to Threat Cloud for distribution to Guard daemons
- Reflected on the ATR website

## Contribution paths

| Path | Who | Flow |
|------|-----|------|
| **Pull request** | Anyone | Fork → write rule → open PR → CI validates → maintainer reviews → merge |
| **Threat Cloud v2** | Guard users | Guard detects → TC aggregates → LLM crystallizes (with tool use: dedup + research grounding) → canary 24h → auto-PR → maintainer reviews → merge |
| **Vendor pack** | Cisco, Microsoft, etc. | Vendor writes rules in own format → adapter converts to ATR YAML → vendor opens PR → CI validates → maintainer reviews → merge |
| **Autoresearch** | ATR pipeline | Adversarial generator creates attack samples → TC crystallizes → same as Threat Cloud path |

## Roadmap

### v1.1 — Technical Steering Committee, Founding Three (Target: Q3 2026)

Single-maintainer governance is the project's primary structural risk. The
Founding Three TSC composition resolves bus-factor=1 and converts ATR from
a project into a standards body.

Target seats (subject to candidate confirmation):

- **Maintainer seat** — Adam Lin (林冠辛), BDFL transitional, ATR project
- **Industry seat** — Vineeth Sai, Cisco AI Defense (PRs #79, #99 merged)
- **Community / threat-intel seat** — Alexandre Dulaunoy, MISP / CIRCL
  (taxonomies #323 and galaxy #1207 merged)

Authority of the Founding Three (once seated):
- Numbering Authority: ID assignment by 2-of-3 majority vote.
- Spec amendments: 2-of-3 majority + 14-day public comment.
- New category admission: 2-of-3 majority + Spec PR.
- Enterprise Member admissions: 2-of-3 majority.

Seat-3 succession on resignation: TSC supermajority (3-of-3) selects the
replacement; no veto by any single seat.

Public meeting cadence: bi-weekly open call, minutes posted to repo.

### v1.2 — Expanded TSC (Target: Q1 2027)

Expand to 5 seats by adding:

- Academic / research seat (independent AI security researcher)
- Government / standards-body seat (CISA, NIST, ENISA, national CERT equivalent)

### v2.0 — Multi-Stakeholder Governance and Standards-Body Submission (2027)

- [ ] Submit ATR Spec v1.0 to a standards body as an Internet-Draft
      (IETF SECEVENT WG candidate) and/or as an OASIS Technical Committee
      contribution; track IANA media-type registration in parallel.
- [ ] Federated Threat Cloud: multiple TC instances sync rules through
      a shared protocol.
- [x] ATR Engine Conformance Test Suite v1.0 in `conformance/` (Spec §12);
      "ATR-Compatible L1/L2/L3" badge program live (suite skeleton shipped
      2026-05-16; first three independent engines passing L2 still
      open).

## ATR Standards Membership

ATR provides two community programs that define the project's relationship with
the broader security industry. Both are governed by [docs/BDFL-charter.md](docs/BDFL-charter.md).

### ATR Certified Skill — Free

ATR Certified Skill is a community designation indicating that an MCP skill has been
reviewed against the current ATR rule corpus and passes with zero critical findings.

- Cost: Zero. No fee, no commercial relationship required.
- Process: community review via GitHub Issue; CI is the authority.
- Validity: 90 days or until a new ATR release affecting relevant rule categories.
- Model: MITRE ATT&CK / Let's Encrypt transparency model. Quality decisions
  are made by the community and enforced by CI — not by any commercial entity.

The ATR Numbering Authority does not charge for, influence, or gatekeep skill
certification outcomes. The CI output is the authoritative source.

### ATR Enterprise Member — $10,000 / year

Enterprise Membership is a governance relationship for organizations that build on
or depend on ATR. Modeled on the Apache Software Foundation Platinum Sponsor model.

- Cost: $10,000 / year per organization.
- Benefits: governance vote (post-TSC), early RFC draft access, 7-day priority PR
  review SLA, logo display in README and website, private coordination channel.
- Eligibility: any organization demonstrably using ATR in a security product,
  research project, or internal tooling.
- Application: open a GitHub Issue with label `enterprise-member-application`.

Enterprise Membership grants governance participation rights. It does NOT grant:
- Any influence over individual rule acceptance or rejection
- Any ability to accelerate or block specific rule IDs
- Any access to non-public data from other organizations' Threat Cloud sensors

Decisions about rule quality are made solely by the CI quality gate and human
reviewers following the standard review process. Enterprise Membership purchases
governance access, not detection quality outcomes.

Full program details: [docs/BDFL-charter.md §Enterprise Member Program](docs/BDFL-charter.md#atr-enterprise-member-program----10000--year).
